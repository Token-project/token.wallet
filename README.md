# Token mobile wallet

## Please note that this is a WIP

This application is a base example for creating a mobile wallet were credentials are stored in the owner's device and not in a 3rd party server.

# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-react-native-app -t with-router
```
